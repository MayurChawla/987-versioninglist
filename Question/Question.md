# A Release Checklist Tool

AI tools are encouraged. Document ALL your design decisions in the README file. Do spend some time initially to plan out how you will do it. Manage your time accordingly. Deploy it online. You can use Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Heroku, Render, etc.

## Task
The goal of this assignment is to build a functional modern web application.

This application is a release checklist tool that could help developers with their release process. Here are the mockups: [Mockup Image](https://public-swap.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/releasecheck.png)

The application has only one main model: **Release**. A Release is composed of multiple Steps and has the following properties:
- **name** (text, mandatory)
- **date** (datetime, mandatory)
- **status** (`planned` | `ongoing` | `done`, auto)
- **additional info** (text, optional)

A release keeps track of the completion state of the different steps. A Step has only two states: `on` or `off`.

The status is not chosen by the end user, it is simply computed from the steps state:
- **No step completed:** `planned`
- **At least one step completed:** `ongoing`
- **All steps completed:** `done`

For the sake of this example, let's assume that a release is done in 7 to 10 steps. The mock-ups include a few example steps but feel free to change them.

To keep things simple, the steps are the same for every release and don't change over time - you don't need to have a database table to store each step, as long as you store, for each release, which step has been completed.

## Must-have Requirements

- Users should be able to view a list of all the releases.
- Users should be able to create a new release (with a name, due date, and optional "additional information").
- Users should be able to check / uncheck the steps that are part of a release.
- Users should be able to update the release additional information.
- The whole codebase should be contained in a single repository available on GitHub.
- The end result should be a single-page application.
- The application state should be stored in a PostgreSQL or MySQL database (hosted online).
- The frontend and the backend should communicate using an API.
- The app is styled with a few CSS rules, and should have a simple, usable UX (no time for fancy design stuff).
- There should be a small `README.md` file with the instructions needed to run the code locally.
- Users should be able to delete a release.
- Users should benefit from a responsive interface.
- The frontend and backend should use GraphQL as the API layer.
- The backend should be easily run locally with Docker (`Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yaml`).
- The codebase should contain a couple of automated tests.
- Please note that this shouldn't be a multi-user application. It does not need any kind of user management.
- In your `README` file, list down your API endpoints as well as your database schema.
- Deploy the API + UI online. You can use Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, Heroku, Render, etc.
- Run a stress scenario on your APIs and find out how many users can it handle simultaneously.
